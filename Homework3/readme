I separate my code into two parts, p1 and p2

# First, you have to put the data folder and the python file in a same folder
# Then run the code, it will train the model from scratch and perform results.

You have to use my code as shown below:
python Homework3.py --batchsize 200 --lr 0.001 --momentum 0.9 --epoch 500 --p1

-- In p1 --
We will run the code as the demand in part 1 of the homework, which is a classifier
with one hidden layer. You can switch the dimension by change the number in the variable "layers"

-- In p2 --
We will run the code as the demand in part 2 of the homework, which is a classifier
with two hidden layer. You can switch the dimension by change the number in the variable "layers"

You can also switch some hyper parameters like batch size, learning rate, momentum of optimizer
, number of training epoch and which part to run by change the number after --batchsize --lr --momentum --epoch --p1

The code will perform a classifier using SGD with momentum, it will generate the plot of training and 
testing loss, accuracy and the decision region of the model.
